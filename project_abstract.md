# Project Abstract

This project explores the application of supervised machine learning methods to predict survival outcomes using publicly available breast cancer clinical data. A structured workflow was developed to preprocess heterogeneous clinical features, including categorical encoding, numerical scaling, and class imbalance correction.

A logistic regression model was trained and evaluated using a stratified train–test framework. Performance was assessed through confusion matrices and classification metrics to emphasize clinically meaningful interpretation beyond overall accuracy. Special attention was given to identifying and removing data leakage to ensure valid predictive modeling.

Feature importance analysis was performed to examine how tumor staging variables, nodal involvement, and demographic factors contribute to survival prediction. This project demonstrates how interpretable machine learning techniques can be applied to biomedical datasets while maintaining methodological rigor.

The work provides a foundation for extending survival modeling toward more advanced bioinformatics and multimodal machine learning applications.
