# Machine-Learning-Survival-Prediction-Breast-Cancer-Clinical-Data My Individual practice and learning with machine learning
This project explores how machine learning can be applied to clinical cancer datasets to predict patient survival outcomes. The goal is to build a scientifically sound workflow that mirrors real biomedical data analysis, emphasizing preprocessing, model validation, and interpretation rather than raw accuracy. Aim for individual practice and learning with machine learning.
Objectives

1. Apply machine learning to clinical survival prediction

2. Handle heterogeneous biomedical data

3. Address class imbalance

4. Prevent data leakage

5. Interpret model outputs in a biological context

Dataset

Public breast cancer clinical dataset containing demographic information, tumor staging variables, lymph node involvement, and survival status.

Workflow

1. Data loading and inspection

2. Categorical feature encoding

3. Feature scaling

4. Train–test split

5. Logistic regression modeling

6. Class imbalance correction

7. Model evaluation (confusion matrix, classification metrics)

8. Feature importance analysis

9. Leakage detection and correction
