# Machine-Learning-Survival-Prediction-Breast-Cancer-Clinical-Data
This project explores how machine learning can be applied to clinical cancer datasets to predict patient survival outcomes. The goal is to build a scientifically sound workflow that mirrors real biomedical data analysis, emphasizing preprocessing, model validation, and interpretation rather than raw accuracy.
